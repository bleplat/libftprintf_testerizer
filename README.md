# libftprintf_testerizer

You can use this project to easily make tests to compare your ft_printf output with the true printf.

It is not possible to do all kind of tests (like %n or %p) yet.

Lots of bonuses are tested, so expect to have a few fails. However you should never crash.

# Install / Usage

Check the .sh file, it contains config on the first lines.
Be sure to change your project directory and remove the additional flags you dont need (or add them, cf fsanitize)
